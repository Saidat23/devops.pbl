In this project, we would be implementing a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

MERN Web stack consists of:

MongoDB: is a document-based, No-SQL database, used to store application data in form of documents.

ExpressJS: is a server side Web Application framework for Node.js.


ReactJS: is a frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript and used to build User Interface (UI) components.
