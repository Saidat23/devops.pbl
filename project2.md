# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)
  This is a similar stack to project1. LEMP is an acronymn for Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl which are individual technologies used together for a specific technology product.
In this project I would be implementing a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server â€“ NGINX, it is also popular and widely used by websites.
With Git Bash downloaded and launched, I would ssh my EC2 instance using the command:  
ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>
## INSTALLING THE NGINX WEB SERVER
