# Devops Tooling Website Solution
---
In this project, we will be building a comprehensive DevOps tooling website solution by exploring the integration of various tools and technology to create a unified platform that enhances automation, 
collaboration and efficiency for software development and operation teams.

In a previous Project, [WordPress Website](https://github.com/Saidat23/devops.pbl/blob/main/WordPress%20Website%20with%20LVM%20Storage%20Management.md), we implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a website or blog. In this project, we will introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day to day activities like managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.
The tools we want our team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so we will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:


Jenkins - free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.

Kubernetes - an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

Jfrog Artifactory - Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

Rancher - an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

Grafana - a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

Prometheus - An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

Kibana - Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.

Note: Do not feel overwhelmed by all the tools and technologies listed above, we will gradually get ourselves familiar with them in upcoming projects!

Side Self Study
Read about Network-attached storage (NAS), Storage Area Network (SAN) and related protocols like NFS, (s)FTP, SMB, iSCSI. Explore what Block-level storage is and how it is used by Cloud Service providers, know the difference from Object storage.
On the example of AWS services understand the difference between Block Storage, Object Storage and Network File System.

Setup and technologies used in Project 7
As a member of a DevOps team, you will implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure  easily accessible.
In this project you will implement a solution that consists of following components:


Infrastructure: AWS

Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

Database Server: Ubuntu  20.04 + MySQL

Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server

Programming Language: PHP

Code Repository: GitHub



For Rhel 8 server use this ami RHEL-8.6.0_HVM-20220503-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2 (ami-035c5dc086849b5de)
