## SHELL SCRIPTING.

Writing out commands on the terminal to carry out task and getting corresponding output can be challenging when we have large number of tasks to carry out. Say we have thousands of repositories to clone. It would take a lot of time and energy to clone the repository one after the other and there might be human error due to fatigue.
To prevent human error, we make use of shell scripting. Shell scripting helps to automate repetitive task by simply writing a script which does the tasks once it is called. this script can be used severally whenever it is needed.
Bash scripts aree series of commands and instructions that are executed sequentially
