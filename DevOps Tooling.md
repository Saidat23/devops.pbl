# Devops Tooling Website Solution
---
In this project, we will be building a comprehensive DevOps tooling website solution by exploring the integration of various tools and technology to create a unified platform that enhances automation, 
collaboration and efficiency for software development and operation teams.

In a previous Project, [WordPress Website](https://github.com/Saidat23/devops.pbl/blob/main/WordPress%20Website%20with%20LVM%20Storage%20Management.md), we implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a website or blog. In this project, we will introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day to day activities like managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.

The DevOps Tooling Solution will consist of:


**Jenkins** - is a free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.

**Kubernetes** - an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

**Jfrog Artifactory** - Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

**Rancher** - an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

**Grafana** - a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

**Prometheus** - An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

**Kibana** - Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.

**Infrastructure**: AWS

**Webserver Linux**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

**Database Server**: Ubuntu  20.04 + MySQL

**Storage Server**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server

**Programming Language**: PHP
