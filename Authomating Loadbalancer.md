# AUTHOMATING LOADBALANCER CONFIGURATION WITH SHELL SCRIPTING.
This project demonstrate how to automate the setup and maintainance of your loadbalancer using a freestyle job to enhance and reduce manual effort. Shell Scripting and simple CI/CD on Jenkins streamline the loadbalancer configuration with ease.

## Automating the Deploment of Webservers.

As DevOps Engineers, automation is the heart of our work. Automation helps us speed the deployment of services and reduce error making in our day to day activities.<br/>
In the implementation of loadbalancer with [Nginx project](https://github.com/Saidat23/devops.pbl/edit/main/Loadbalancing%20with%20Nginx.md), we deployed two backend servers with a loadbalancer distributing traffic across the webservers. This was done by typing the commands right on the terminal.<br/>
In this project, we will be automating the entire process by writing a shell script that when ran, it will automatically run all we did manually in the Nginx project.<br/>
