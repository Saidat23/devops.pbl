# INTRODUCTION TO LINUX AND BASIC OPERATING COMMANDS
Linux is an Open-Source Unix operating system based on the Linux Kernel. They include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat and openSUSE. It is common practice to use Linux to manage a Vitual Private Server (VPS). A shell, (a program which gives access to the operating system's service) is used when operating Linux. Linux can be operated in two different ways: Graphical user interface (GUI) which makes it beginner-friendly and Command Line Interface (CLI) which is quicker and offers more control. 

## LINUX PRACTICE PROJECT
 This is an interractive program designed for beginners who wants to explore the world of Linux through hands-on exercise. This project is focused on practical application and experimental learning to gain valuable experience on use of Linux in the real-world scenarios.  
This project is to reinforce the understanding of Linux concepts and building Linux skills step by step. Starting with basic command line operations, file management, package installation and directory navigation through to more advanced topics like user and permission managemment, package instalation and network configuration.
This project provide a supportive learning environment to practice and refine Linux skills. It is a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on experiment and develop a solid foundation in Linux operating system.
