# INTRODUCTION TO LINUX AND BASIC OPERATING COMMANDS
Linux is an Open-Source Unix operating system based on the Linux Kernel. They include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat and openSUSE. It is common practice to use Linux to manage a Vitual Private Server (VPS). A shell, (a program which gives access to the operating system's service) is used when operating Linux. Linux can be operated in two different ways through Graphical user interface(GUI)- beginner-friendly and Command Line Interface(CLI)- quicker and offers more control.
## LINUX COMMAND
A linux command is a program that runs on the CLI by interacting with the system via texts and processes. Commands can be used to perform various task on the CLI from package installation to user management and file manipulation. The commands are executed on the terminal by pressing the enter key on the keyboard at the end of each line. The commands are case sensitive and these are three most common parts of a command:
CommanName- is the rule that you want to perform
Option or Flag- modifies a command's operation 
Parameter or Argument- specifies any  necessary information for the command.    
## LINUX PRACTICE PROJECT
 This is an interractive program designed for beginners who wants to explore the world of Linux through hands-on exercise. This project is focused on practical application and experimental learning to gain valuable experience on use of Linux in the real-world scenarios.  
This project is to reinforce the understanding of Linux concepts and building Linux skills step by step. Starting with basic command line operations, file management, package installation and directory navigation through to more advanced topics like user and permission managemment, package instalation and network configuration.
This project provide a supportive learning environment to practice and refine Linux skills. It is a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on experiment and develop a solid foundation in Linux operating system.
## FILE MANIPULATION

1. sudo command: this is short for superuser do, sudo is one of the most popular basic Linux commands that lets you perform tasks that require administrative or root permissions.  
Syntax: sudo (command) eg sudo apt upgrade. 
Flags: -k or -reset-timestamp(invalidates the timestamp file), -g or -group(run commands as a specified group name or ID) and -h or -host(host runs commands on the host).

2. pwd command: used to find the path of the current working directory.
Syntax: pwd 
Flags: -L or logical ( print environment variable content including symbollic links) -P of physical (prints the actual path of the current direct).
