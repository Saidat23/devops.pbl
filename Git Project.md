# GIT PROJECT
  This basic Git project is a collection of beginner-friendly tasks designed to introduce you into the fundamentals of Git. Git is a powerful version control system widely used in software development.This mini project will help learners to quickly grasp the core concepts and confidently utilize Git in projects.[^1]

  Throughout the implementation, you will learn how to efficiently initialize a repository and make commits. Work with branches, collaboration, remote repositories, tagging, track changes, highlighting the significance of Git and also emphasizeing the best practices for maintaining a clean commit history, optimizing workflows and troubleshooting common issues.[^2]
## INITIALIZING A GIT REPOSITORY
  You have to install Git on your computer before initializing the Git repository. Select your desired operating system when you want to install your Git. It could be a windows, Mac or Linux operating system. To initialize the Git repository, open your prefered terminal on your computer which could  be Git bash, Visual studio, Mac terminal etc. On the terminal, create your working folder or directory using the mkdir command eg (mkdir Devops). Change into your working directory using the command (cd Devops) then run the "git init" command while you are in the Devops directory.
## MAKING YOUR FIRST COMMIT  
  In the last section, we succesfully created our working directory and initialized a git repository. We are now going to make our first commit. In git, commit is saving the changes made to the files which could be adding, modifying or deleting text or files.[^3]
  Let us make our first commit following these steps:
  -- Using the touch command, create a file "index.txt" inside your working directory. eg touch index.txt
  -- Write any sentence of your choice inside the text file and save changes.
  -- Add the changes to git staging area using the command "git add ."
  -- To commit your changes sto git, run the command "git commit -m "initial commit".
