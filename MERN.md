# MERN STACK IMPLEMENTATION

In this project, we would be implementing a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

MERN Web stack consists of:

MongoDB: is a document-based, No-SQL database, used to store application data in form of documents.

ExpressJS: is a server side Web Application framework for Node.js.


ReactJS: is a frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript and used to build User Interface (UI) components.


Node.js: is a JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine.


The diagram below illustrate how the MERN Stack work.

When a user interacts with the ReactJS UI components at the application front-end in the browser. The application backend in the server respond to the frontend through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS.

Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server, which request for data from the MongoDB database. The data received is sent back to the frontend application, and presented to the user.
